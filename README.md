# Supported Formats

`bin/box_cover` works with TSV file and User-Generated graph.

## TSV files 
* By using the option `-type=tsv`, you can specify .tsv file as the graph file with the option `-graph=...`.
* In a .tsv file, each line should contain two integers describing an edge (see below).
* Vertices should be described by integers starting from zero.

### TSV file example
```
0 1
0 2
1 2
```

## User-Generated graph
By using the option `-type=gen`, you can generate and use famous network models.
```
./bin/box_cover -type=gen -graph="ba 1000 3"
```

### Barabási–Albert model
By using `-graph="ba v u"`, you can generate and use Barabási–Albert model with v nodes, which is generated from complete graph with u nodes.

For example, by using `-graph="ba 1000 3"`, a BA model graph, which has 1000 nodes and 2994 edges, will be genearated.

### (u, v)-flower
By using `-graph="flower N u v"`, you can generate and use (u, v)-flower which has at least N nodes.

For example, by using `-graph="flower 1000 1 2"`, (1, 2)-flower, which has 1095 nodes, will be genearated.

### Song-Havlin-Makse model
By using `-graph="shm N s t"`, you can generate and use Song-Havlin-Makse model which is generated from s-nodes star graph, added t*d new nodes to each node of degree d in each step, and finally has at least N nodes.

For example, by using `-graph="shm 1000 5 2"`, SHM model, which is generated from 5-nodes star graph and has 2501 nodes and 2500 edges, will be genearated.
